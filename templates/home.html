The Mesoamerican Language Collections (MLC) brings together multiple
collections of materials documenting Mesoamerican Languages produced by
University of Chicago linguists and ethnographers since 1932. They are
the legacy of work started by Norman McQuown (1914-2004), University of
Chicago anthropologist and linguist, and carried on by his former
student John Lucy, who collected and preserved primary documentation
about Mesoamerican languages produced by their colleagues and students
over the bulk of the 20th and early 21st Centuries. These collections
consist of the Manuscripts in Cultural Anthropology (MCA), a manuscript
collections of field notes, vocabulary lists, dictionaries, grammars,
corpora of texts and elicited sentences, concordances, and guides to
holdings of other research collections; the Digital Media Archives
(DMA), a broader digital collection of recorded audio one of the largest
components of which  are the field recordings of Mesoamerican linguists;
the Chicago Archive of Indigenous Language Literatures of the Americas,
published works in indigenous languages (again overwhelmingly
Mesoamerican) collected by MCA and DMA contributors, including original
prose and poetry, translations from other languages, childrenâ€™s
literature, pedagogical materials, periodicals, and more; and language
teaching materials produced by University of Chicago linguists and
anthropologists to train their future colleagues.
