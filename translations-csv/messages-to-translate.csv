"templates/mlc/home.html:20","The Mesoamerican Language Collections (MLC) brings together multiple collections of materials documenting Mesoamerican Languages produced by University of Chicago linguists and ethnographers since 1932. They are the legacy of work started by Norman McQuown (1914-2004), University of Chicago anthropologist and linguist, and carried on by his former student John Lucy, who collected and preserved primary documentation about Mesoamerican languages produced by their colleagues and students over the bulk of the 20th and early 21st Centuries.
